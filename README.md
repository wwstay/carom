Match-Maker is an entity-resolution/deduplication algorithm.

dedup_analysis consists of the main code. In there open the folder containing the ipython notebooks. The file that has python3 in its name is the workable code. Open that and you should be able to work through the stuff written in there.

The documentation is all in Sphinx. You can see that in the \_build portion of the repository
